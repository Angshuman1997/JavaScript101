How JavaScript works ?

In JavaScript, the work process happens based on the execution context which is an abstract concept that helps manage the execution of code.

Before the code execution, a memory allocation process happens where all the variables and functions are declared. "undefined" value is alloted to the variables and for functions the whole function object is alloted.

After that the code execution process happens.

Whenever a new type of scope (function or block) are executed another execution contexts are formed.

All the execution context are put into a call stack in LIFO formate.

In the code execution whenever a variable is assigned to a new value in the memory allocation the variables value changes.

After every completion of a execution context, it is removed from the call stack.
