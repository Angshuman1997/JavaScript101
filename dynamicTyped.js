// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that variables' data types are determined by the value that 
// they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.

let a = 2;

console.log(typeof a); // Output --> number

a = "Hi"

console.log(typeof a); // Output --> string
