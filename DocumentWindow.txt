In JavaScript, document and window are important objects that provide access to 
various properties and methods related to the web page and the browser window. 
Let's take a closer look at each: 

Document Object (document): The document object represents the HTML document 
that's currently loaded in the browser. It provides a way to manipulate and 
interact with the content of the web page. 

Example usages of the document object:

// Changing the text content of an element with ID "myElement"
document.getElementById("myElement").textContent = "New text";

// Creating a new paragraph element and appending it to the body
const newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);

Window Object (window): The window object represents the browser window or tab. 
It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser environment. 

Example usages of the window object:

// Opening a new browser window
window.open("https://www.example.com", "_blank");

// Alerting a message to the user
window.alert("Hello, world!");

// Checking the width and height of the browser window
const windowWidth = window.innerWidth;
const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;

One key point to remember is that the window object is the global object in a browser environment.
This means that you can often omit the window prefix when accessing its properties and methods. 
For example, you can use window.alert() or simply alert(). 

Both document and window provide essential features for manipulating the content and behavior of 
web pages, making them crucial objects when working with JavaScript in the browser.
