<!-- Debouncing is a JavaScript technique used to control the rate at which a particular function is executed, primarily in response to events like user input or other rapid-fire events. The main purpose of debouncing is to ensure that a function is executed only after a certain period of inactivity or a pause in the triggering event. This helps prevent the function from being called too frequently, which can lead to performance issues and unintended consequences in a web application. -->
