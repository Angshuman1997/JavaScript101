Explain Nan, and undeclared. 

NaN (Not-a-Number): NaN is a special value that represents the result of a 
mathematical operation that cannot be performed, such as dividing zero by zero. 
It is often the result of trying to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric 
values. It's important to note that NaN is not equal to any other value, including itself. 

Example: const result = "hello" / 2; // result is NaN 

Undeclared: An "undeclared" variable is a variable that has been used in code 
without being explicitly declared using var, let, or const. When you try to 
use an undeclared variable, JavaScript will treat it as a global variable if 
strict mode is not enabled, which can lead to unintended behaviour and errors. 
It's good practice to always declare variables before using them to avoid potential issues. 

Example: undeclaredVariable = 42; // This creates a global variable if not in strict mode
