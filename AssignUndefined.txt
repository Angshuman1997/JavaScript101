Can undefined be assigned?

Yes, you can explicitly assign the value undefined to a variable in JavaScript. 
However, it's more common for the value undefined to be automatically assigned 
to a variable that has been declared but not initialized with a value. Here's 
how you can assign undefined to a variable:

let x = undefined; // Explicitly assigning undefined

let y; // y is automatically assigned the value undefined
